#### plan
- routing for serotonin to take live and also rect/cycle/noise
- make a serotonin drum machine

#### minor (feature adds, wont break)
- prevent arbitrary params from being set?
- need @decorators for note wrappers
- how to connect directly to AU DLS Synth
- could use a cycles callback on driver or voice for general sequencing

#### major (will break)
- integrate lilypond
