making this an instrument, not a compositional tool (no sequencing controls)

so how are you going to control it?

livecode.

controller: just like before, functions that define presets, and take a transition time that goes to the tweens.

/

PLAN: 
microrhythms
then get adsr in there somehow.
then get the controller up.
then make some fucking music already.

/

LIVECODING:
- logs -> print
- need more error handling, assertion, etc

- need to be able to start a thread aligned with another

/

DOCS:
blend, euclidean

/


BUGS:

direct sync not working

sync is a little weird if the rate is already the same -- just jumps phase (why?)
