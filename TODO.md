### BUGS

- global tempo change messes up tweens


### FEATURES

- need to be able to start a thread aligned with another
    thread1.sync(thread2)
    or better
    thread1.start(thread2)  <-- grabs its cycles

- microrhythm functions

- default tempo (after fixing above) probably shouldnt be 240


### concept

- the linear cyclical
- the material semiotic
